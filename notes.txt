EDA
- Need to figure out what is relevant.
- Histograms will work regardless
- Might need to split each tag into it's components (painful) and count those
- Some tokens may need to be deleted (stopwords and punctuation) but because we're modelling POS might be a dumb idea
- Can use GGPlot with plotnine (pretty cool option)

Data Prep
- Might need to arrange data so that each sentence is in its own cell instead of each word in its own cell
