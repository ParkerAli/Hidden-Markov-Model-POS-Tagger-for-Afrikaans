EDA
- Need to figure out what is relevant.
- Histograms will work regardless
- Might need to split each tag into it's components (painful) and count those
- Some tokens may need to be deleted (stopwords and punctuation) but because we're modelling POS might be a dumb idea
- Can use GGPlot with plotnine (pretty cool option)

Data Prep
- Might need to arrange data so that each sentence is in its own cell instead of each word in its own cell

HMM
- brilliant implementation (https://www.mygreatlearning.com/blog/pos-tagging/)
- another really good source (https://github.com/amanjeetsahu/Natural-Language-Processing-Specialization/blob/master/Natural%20Language%20Processing%20with%20Probabilistic%20Models/Week%202/C2_W2_Assignment_Solution.ipynb)
